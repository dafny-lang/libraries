## The `Math` module {#sec-math}

The `Math` module currently contains a few integer-related math functions (e.g. Min, Max, Abs).
- Functions over integers using multiply, divide and modulo are handled in the
`NonlinearArith` module, along with lemmas about those functions.
- Integer-related functions over collections of integers (e.g. minimum of a sequence) are
available in the `Collections` module.
